        <h2>Misalignment with business processes - failures often happen when teams put technology ahead of strategy.<br>

            Lack of cross-functional expertise - people believe that teams should consist of digital people for the programming but you should always have someone that has business process managements skills.<br>
            
            Over ambition - trying to include too much in a project can cause it to fail as you can be too focused on one part than something else.
