        <h1><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anton&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">GDPR</h1>
        <h2>GDPR Stands for General Data Protection Regulations.<br><br>
            starts on the 25th February 2018 and if organisations do not comply the could face heavy fines.<br><br></h2>
        <h1>Child Consent<br><br></h1>
        <h2>The GDPR states that a child can consent to data processing at age 16, whilst the DPA sets this at 13.<br><br></h2>
        <h1>Extended Definition of Identifier<br><br></h1>
        <h2>The GDPR extends the meaning of ‘identifier’ to include IP addresses, internet cookies and DNA in the definition of personal data<br><br></h2>
        <h1>Criminal Data<br><br></h1>
        <h2>The GDPR requires those processing criminal data to have official authority, the DPA does not.<br><br></h2>
        <h1>Automated decision making/processing<br><br></h1>
        <h2>The GDPR states that data subjects have a right not to be subject to automated decision making or profiling, whereas the DPA allows for this whenever there are legitimate grounds for doing so and safeguards are in place to protect individual rights and freedoms.<br><br></h2>
        <h1>Data Subject Rights<br><br></h1>
        <h2>The GDPR ensures that all data subjects have rights in relation to the processing of their personal data.<br>
            The DPA allows these rights to be ignored if compliance with these rights would seriously impact an organisation’s ability to carry out their functions when processing data for scientific, historical, statistical and archiving purposes.<br><br></h2>
        <h1>Privacy vs Freedom of expression<br><br></h1>
        <h2>The GDPR gives Member States scope to balance the right to privacy with the right to freedom of expression and information.<br>
            The DPA provides an exemption from certain requirements of personal data protection in respect of personal data processed for publication in the public interest.</h2>
